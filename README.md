# Project 3

### US Demographic

  In this project, I decided to work on US demographic, using data gathered from US Census Bureau. I focused on the year of 2017, showcasing the total population of each data, including the specification of different races from each state.

### Takeaways

- This project highlighted the fact that Native Americans are the minority group throughout all the states in the United States. While the White population seems to be dominating the majority of the country, if not all. 
- With the information gathered, this could be useful for companies who are looking for a particular group of people to target, whether it's races, age, or from a specific state, with the intention of advertising their products or company.
